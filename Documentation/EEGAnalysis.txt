	#Description
	
	* EEG spectral data analysis for spectral power and spectral gain analysis.
	* Activity is measure using PIR motion sensor.
	* State concerns Wake [w], NREM[n] and REM[n]

	#Description
	EEG and Behavioral sleep phenotypes.
	Phenotypes contain:
	 	 	
	* activity
	* EEG
	* State
	 
	The directory "Phenotypes/" contains the following information:
	 
	* $<line (BXD lines) [BXD]>
	* mouseID (in format "lines"_"mouseID")
	* room (room used for recording)
	* rec (recording time period)
	* worm (worm detection yes:1 no:0)
	* Phenotypes ...
	 
	A mean value per lines was computed and stored into the following files:
	 	
	* as text: AllPheno.txt
	* as Rdata matrix: SleepPhenotype.Rdata
